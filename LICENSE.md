# 9. No Warranties and Guarantees

TTI HAS PROVIDED THE DELIVERABLES AND SUPPORT SERVICES, IF ANY, ON AN &quot;AS-IS,&quot; &quot;WHERE IS&quot; BASIS. NO WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE DELIVERABLES OR SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ALTERA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN.

No representation or other affirmation of fact, including but limited to statement regarding capacity, suitability for use or performance of the Deliverables, whether made by TTI employees or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a warranty for any purpose or give rise to any liability of TTI whatsoever. By making the Deliverables available, TTI expressly does not recommend, suggest, or require that the Deliverables be used in combination with any other product not provided by TTI. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusions may not apply to Licensee in full, but shall be interpreted to apply to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law.

# 10. Limitations of Liability

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted by law:

10.1 In no event shall the aggregate liability of TTI relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof under any legal theory (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), including any liability for any loss or damages directly or indirectly suffered by Licensee relating to the Deliverables, exceed the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of the license fees actually paid by Licensee under this Agreement or (b) One Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD$1,000).

10.2 IN NO EVENT SHALL TTI BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE (a) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, OR LOST OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, (b) FOR ANY LOSS OF OR DAMAGES TO OTHER SOFTWARE OR DATA, OR (c) FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE, SUPPORT, OPERATION, OR FAILURE OF THE DELIVERABLES, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF TTI HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY AND DAMAGES. LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TTI HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR DUTY TO DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, OR HOLD LICENSEE HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS, SUITS, PROCEEDINGS, DAMAGES, LOSTS, COSTS AND EXPENSES BASED ON PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS.

10.3 The limitations set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 above shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy stated herein.

10.4 TTI is willing to enter into this Agreement only in consideration of and in reliance upon the provisions contained herein limiting TTI&#39;s exposure to liability. Such provisions constitute an essential part of the bargain underlying this Agreement and have been reflected in the consideration agreed upon by the Parties. Both Parties understand and agree that the exclusion of warranties, limitation of liability, and the limitation of remedies allocate risks between the Parties as authorized under applicable law.

10.5 The Reference Design may contain or be derived from portions of code and documentation provided by third parties under license to TTI. To the extent that the Deliverables are developed by a third party or derived from third-party software, no such third party provides any representations or warranties with respect to the Deliverables, assumes any liability regarding use of the Deliverables, or undertakes to furnish Licensee any support or information relating to the Deliverables. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Licensee agrees that TTI may disclose Licensee&#39;s identity by name and address, and identify the Deliverables licensed, to the extent required by agreement with its licensors and partners.

# 11. General

11.1 TTI shall have a right to audit any Licensee records to confirm Licensee&#39;s compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. Such audit (a) shall be conducted at Licensee&#39;s facilities at reasonable times upon reasonable prior written notice as needed to verify Licensee&#39;s compliance with its obligations under this Agreement, and (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee&#39;s normal business operations. This Section 11.1 shall survive for one (1) year after expiration or termination of this Agreement.

11.2 Licensee may not sublicense, assign, or transfer this Agreement or the licenses granted, or any rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, or any Deliverables, whether by operation or law or otherwise, or disclose any trade secrets or Confidential Information embodied in the Deliverables, except as expressly provided in this Agreement. Any attempt to sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer without prior written consent of the other Party any of the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder is void. For the purposes of this Section, a change in the persons or entities that directly or indirectly control fifty percent (50%) or more of the equity securities or beneficial or voting interest of Licensee shall be considered an assignment by Licensee and shall require the other Party&#39;s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

11.3 This Agreement is entered into for the benefit of TTI and its licensors and all rights granted to Licensee and all obligations owed to TTI shall be enforceable by TTI.

11.4 It is expressly agreed that the validity and construction of this Agreement, and performance hereunder, shall be governed by the laws of the Netherlands. The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in the Amsterdam for the resolution of any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

11.6 No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of both Parties. The waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a waiver of any other right hereunder.

11.7 If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

11.8 BY USING THE DELIVERABLES OR ANY PART THEREOF, LICENSEE AND TTI ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LICENSEE AND TTI HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. LICENSEE AND TTI FURTHER AGREE THAT IT IS THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN LICENSEE AND TTI, WHICH SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN LICENSEE AND TTI RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT.

11.9 Licensee agrees (on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries, and other affiliated parties) that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries or other affiliated parties will, whether during or after the term of this Agreement, institute any claim or action against TTI, or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of TTI, that is based in whole or in part on infringement (whether direct or contributory infringement, inducement to infringe, or otherwise) of any Licensee intellectual property rights in connection with the use, license, offer to license, importing, exporting, or otherwise disposing of the Deliverables, including any portion, enhancements, modifications, or derivative works thereof (collectively, &quot; **Subject Claims**&quot;), or authorize any third party to file any Subject Claims. This covenant shall extend to any Subject Claims against third-party manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, resellers, partners, customers, and other licensees of TTI or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of TTI. This covenant shall apply to and be binding on any assignees, licensees, or other transferees of Licensee&#39;s intellectual property rights. To the extent that such covenant shall not automatically be binding on any such assignees, licensees, or other transferees, the assigning party shall cause such covenant to be so binding and shall indemnify and hold harmless TTI, against all damages, costs, expenses, and other liabilities (including attorneys&#39; fees) incurred by TTI, or any subsidiaries or other affiliated parties of TTI, that result from or relate to any failure to cause such covenant to be so binding.
